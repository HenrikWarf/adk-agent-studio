# Chat Memory & Session Management

## ‚úÖ Verified: Chat Memory IS Working Correctly

After thorough testing, the agent conversation memory is functioning as designed:

### How It Works

1. **Session Persistence**: Each `AgentManager` instance maintains a persistent session with unique `user_id` and `session_id`
2. **Automatic History**: The Google ADK `Runner` automatically includes full conversation history with each message
3. **Event Storage**: The session stores all interactions in the `events` attribute
4. **Context Retention**: Agents can reference any previous message in the conversation

### Test Results

```
‚úÖ PASS: Agent remembered the name ("Alice")
‚úÖ PASS: Agent remembered the programming language ("Python")
‚úÖ PASS: Session history correctly stored (6 events after 3 exchanges)
```

### Implementation Details

- **Session Events**: Conversation history is stored in `session.events`, not `session.turns` or `session.history`
- **Event Structure**: Each event contains `content` with `role` (user/model) and `parts` (message text)
- **History Retrieval**: Use `agent_manager.get_conversation_history()` to fetch the full conversation

### UI Chat Mode

The Streamlit UI chat mode correctly implements:
- ‚úÖ Persistent `AgentManager` instance in `st.session_state`
- ‚úÖ Same `session_id` used across all messages
- ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup when switching agents
- ‚úÖ Session info display with history debugging

### Common Issues & Solutions

**If you experience memory loss:**

1. **Agent switching**: Verify you're not creating a new agent between messages
2. **Session reset**: Check that `session_id` remains constant
3. **Sequential agents**: Note that workflow agents may handle history differently

**Debugging tips:**

- Click "üîç Check ADK Session History" in the UI to see actual stored events
- Check terminal output for session_id consistency
- Use `await agent.get_conversation_history()` to inspect the conversation programmatically

### Code Example

```python
# Initialize agent once
agent = AgentManager("configs/template_agent.json")
await agent.initialize()

# Multiple messages - history is maintained automatically
response1 = await agent.send_message("My name is Alice")
response2 = await agent.send_message("What is my name?")  # Agent knows: "Alice"

# Retrieve full history
history = await agent.get_conversation_history()
print(f"Conversation has {len(history)} turns")

await agent.close()
```

### Summary

**The chat memory system is fully functional.** The Google ADK automatically manages conversation history when using the same session. The issue you experienced may have been due to:
- Creating new agent instances between messages (fixed in UI)
- Testing with Sequential agents (which work differently)
- Edge case scenarios that have now been addressed
